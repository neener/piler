Technology used:

The library has 4 modular connections which use Active_record to persist to the database(PostGresQL):

require_relative "../lib/comment.rb"
require_relative "../lib/neighborhood.rb"
require_relative "../lib/report.rb"
require_relative "../lib/user.rb"

You need to bundle install the gem file first.

The database is called 'piler' and can be created by running the schema.sql
The database can be seeded using the seed.rb file

The following scripts are being use:
jquery
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
underscore.js
<script src="http://underscorejs.org/underscore.js"></script>
googlemap api
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyD2cbRqSmMdgLPExYSf-TwneYwlZjtbyqg"></script>
